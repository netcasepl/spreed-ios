# Nextclod iOS app for the Spreed video & voice calls app

This is a fork of the [Spreed.me iOS app](https://github.com/strukturag/spreedme-iosapp) which was developed for the initial Spreed.me service. We will use this code as a basis to develop the iOS app for the Nextcloud Spreed video & voice conferencing app.

This app doesn't work yet with the Nextcloud Spreed server app. But we invite everyone interested in it to join us in making this app compatible with Nextcloud.

Discuss your ideas about the Nextcloud Spreed app at https://help.nextcloud.com or on our IRC channels #nextcloud & #nextcloud-mobile (on freenode).
